**dojo/store/JsonRest** is a lightweight object store implementation of an HTTP-based (RFC 2616) client with RESTful data interaction capabilities. This store implements the new :ref:`Dojo Object Store API <dojo/store>`.


Introduction
============

JsonRest provides full read, write, and notification capabilities through standards based HTTP/REST interaction with the server using GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE commands. This data store allows you to communicate with server side database/persistent data storage using the Dojo Data API with JavaScript and efficiently handles create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. This can greatly simplify client server communication, interacting can be done simply using straightforward JavaScript instead of having to build your communication for CRUD actions.

Examples
========

.. js ::

 require(["dojo/store/JsonRest"], function(JsonRestStore){

   var store = new JsonRestStore({target: "/Table/" });

   store.get(3).then(function(object){
     // use the object with the identity of 3
   });

   store.query("foo=bar").then(function(results){
     // use the query results returned from the server
   });

   store.put({ foo: "bar" }, { id: 3 }); // store the object with the given identity

   store.remove(3); // delete the object
 });

Implementing a REST Server
==========================

The JsonRest store follows `RFC 2616 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt>`_ whenever possible to define the interaction with the server. JsonRest uses an HTTP GET request to retrieve data, a PUT or POST request to change items, a DELETE request to delete items, and a POST or PUT request to create new items. It is recommended that the server follow a URL structure for resources as follows:

 /{Table}/{id}

This URL will be used to retrieve items by identity and make modifications (PUT and DELETE). It is also recommended that a /{Table}/ URL is used to represent the entire collection of items for the store. When a query is performed, any query string is appended to the target URL to retrieve the results of the query. The JsonRest expects the results to be returned in an array (not in an object with an items property like some stores). The store will also POST to that URL to create new items.

Method Mapping
==============

With the JsonRest store, store methods should intuitively map to HTTP methods:

* get(id) - This will trigger a GET request to {target}{id}.
* query(query, options) - This will trigger a GET request to {target}{query}. If ``query`` is an object, it will be serialized using :ref:`dojo.objectToQuery <dojo/objectToQuery>`. If ``query`` is a string, it is appended to the URL as-is. If ``options`` includes a ``sort`` property, it will be serialized as a query parameter as well; see `Sorting`_ for more information.
* remove(id) - This will trigger a DELETE request to {target}{id}.
* put(object, options) - If object includes an identity property, or options includes an id, this will trigger a PUT request to {target}{id} with the request body being the provided object serialized as JSON. If no identity is provided, then a POST request is made to the store's target URL (no id appended) with the object as the body. If the options.incremental property is true, then a POST request is made to {target}{id} with the object as the body. You may also include an options.overwrite property. If overwrite is set to true, then an If-Match: * header is included. If overwrite is set to false, then an If-None-Match: * header is included.
* add(object, options) - This behaves exactly like put(object, options), except that options.overwrite is set to false, indicating that a new object must be created.

Paging
======

JsonRest store uses HTTP's Range header to perform paging. When a request is made for a range of items, JsonRest will include a Range header with an items range unit specifying the range:

 Range: items=0-24

On your server, you should look at the Range header in the request to know which items to return. The server should respond with a Content-Range header to indicate how many items are being returned and how many total items exist:

 Content-Range: items 0-24/66

The returned total is available as a further promise on the returned promise of data which returns the total number of available rows indicated in the Content-Range header as a number, so you can retrieve it like this:

.. js ::
 
  var _this = this,
    queryResults = this.store.query(this.query, this.queryOpts);
  
  queryResults.then(function(data){
    queryResults.total.then(function(totalResults){
      console.log("total results: ", totalResults);
      console.log("go on and use data ", data, " with this ", _this);
    })
  })

Sorting
=======

When a query request is made that includes a ``sort`` option in the ``options`` object, an additional sort field is added to the query string. If the storeâ€™s ``sortParam`` property is set, it will use that value as the key for the field in the query string.

For example, given the following store and request:

.. js ::
 
  var store = new JsonRestStore({
    target: "/FooObject/",
    sortParam: "sortBy"
  });

  store.query({ foo: "value1" }, {
    sort: [
      { attribute: "foo" },
      { attribute: "bar", descending: true }
    ]
  });

The resulting request to the server would be:

  /FooObject/?foo=value1&sortBy=+foo,-bar

If ``sortParam`` is not set, the sort value is appended without a key-value pair, surrounded by "sort()":

  /FooObject/?foo=value1&sort(+foo,-bar)


Headers
=======

Starting in Dojo 1.8, it is possible to send headers along with all requests made using the JsonRest store. This can either be done by setting the ``headers`` property of the store itself, in which case all requests will include the provided headers, or on a per-call basis by setting the ``headers`` property of the associated ``options`` object for calls to ``get``, ``add``, ``put``, ``remove``, or ``query``.

If header is provided on the ``options`` object passed to a call, it will override any similarly-named headers given directly on the store.

.. js ::
 
  var store = new JsonRestStore({
    target: "/FooObject/",
    headers: { "X-Custom-Header": "Foo" } // All calls to server will include X-Custom-Header: Foo
  });

  store.query({ foo: "value1" }, {
    headers: { "X-Custom-Header": "Bar" } // This call will include X-Custom-Header: Bar instead
  });

Misc
====

dojo/store/JsonRest does not provide all the functionality of dojox/data/JsonRestStore itself. Additional modules and layers are used to provide schema validation, referencing, caching, and other functionality.
